# Movie Project
 
In this project I worked with a dataset from (https://github.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats) which scraped movie listings and ratings from IMDB. I perform some data analysis on the dataset and train some machine learning models to predict the scores of the films.

### Files
* MovieTraining.ipynb - The notebook that holds the analysis and models
* moviesDB.csv - The dataset of the films
